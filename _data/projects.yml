  title: "Learn and Enhance BrainIAK Tutorials: From Basics to Advanced fMRI Analyses"
  image: brainiak.png
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>This project will help participants learn fMRI analyses and enhance BrainIAK Tutorials (Kumar et al., 2020).
  Participants can practice a tutorial covering any topic of interest, from basics to advanced techniques.
  They can also contribute to the tutorials, by making edits, fixing bugs, or enhancing them by applying the techniques
  to their own datasets. We have a list an issue list for the tutorials that participants can pick an issue and work on.
  Some of the advanced techniques included are: Inter-Subject Correlations (ISC) (Hasson et al., 2004; Simony et al., 2016),
  Shared Response Modeling (SRM) (Chen et al., 2015), and Event Segmentation methods (Baldassano et al., 2017)

  title: "Tools for Combatting Citation Bias"
  image: Tools_citation_bias.PNG
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>Recent work in neuroscience and other fields has identified a bias in citation practices such that papers from women
  and other minorities are under-cited relative to the number of such papers in the field. For this project, we seek to further the
  development of two tools to help researchers combat these trends in their own citation practices. The first tool is an interactive jupyter
  notebook that provides probabilistic gender break down of first and last authors from a bibliography in a bibtex file. The second is a Google
  Chrome extension that displays the probabilistic gender of first and last authors of papers on the common search engines Google Scholar and PubMed.

  title: "shimming toolbox: Ecosystem for real-time shimming with MRI"
  image: shimming.png
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>A prerequisite to correcting/shimming the MR 'B0' field is of course to
  measure it (commonly done using a dual-echo gradient-echo sequence). A recent paper
  by <a href=https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/aae570>Fatnassi and Zaidi</a>
  suggests that multi-echo (n>2) sequences may yield better accuracy and higher SNR.
  This brainhack project aims to implement multi-echo field mapping algorithms and assess their efficiency.

  title: "Vector Embeddings of Brain Dynamics"
  image: vectorbraindynamics.png
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>Whereas we can build time-varying functional connectivity (TVFC) graphs
  easily and efficiently using instantaneous wavelet coherence. And whereas we can
  compare TVFC graphs using a host of graph-graph metrics---from simple edge-wise
  overlap, to more robust methods from topological data analysis. The capacity to
  understand how TVFC states compare among volunteers is limited by the transductive
  nature of state-of-the-art manifold embedding algorithms such as tSNE and UMAP.
  Transductive methods tend to overweight the temporal adjacencies of graph-graph
  distances measured within single volunteers, and thereby ignore the large-scale
  graph-graph similarities measured across volunteers. To address this issue, this
  project aims to build vector embeddings of several TVFC graph-graph distances using
  a Siamese neural network.

  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>The parameter space of M/EEG analysis pipelines is like a jungle.
  We will map it! We will first identify and classify available pipelines (based on available pre-registrations)
  and identify common challenges researchers face, then come up with a semantic framework to create and compare different pipelines,
  map software options onto the different analysis steps, and finally start designing an adaptive app for M/EEG pre-registration!

  title: "Tutorial for cross decomposition algorithms (e.g. CCA, PLS) in Python"
  image: decompositionalgorithms.gif
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>Cross decomposition algorithms look for the relations between two (or more) blocks of variables.
  These methods are particularly used in neuroimaging to analyze associations between physiological/behavioral variables and brain structure/function.
  Between unsupervised and supervised modeling, this family of algorithms has many members (e.g. CCA, PLS regression, PLS canonical, PLS-PM, etc.)
  and many approaches are possible to validate the trained model (e.g. cross validation, bootstrapping, permutation test, etc.).
  In this project, I propose to write several Python tutorials to help the application and interpretation of these models in practice.

  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>The <a href=https://osf.io/>Open Science Framework (OSF)</a> is an amazing infrastructure for open science.
  In this project, we attempt to create a <a href=https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/>git-annex special remote implementation</a> to leverage OSF filestorage and make the data storing that OSF provides even more useful.
  The git-annex OFS special remote would allow to transform OSF storage into git-annex repositories.
  Files in OSF storage could thus be consumed or exported fast and easily via git-annex or <a href=https://github.com/datalad/datalad>datalad</a>, and published to repository-hosting services (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, ...) as lightweight repositories that constitute an alternative access to the data stored on the OSF - that is:
  you can <code>git clone</code> a repository from for example GitHub and get the data from the OSF from the command line or in your scripts.

  title: "Multi-modality neurofeedback and biofeedback to treat children with ADHD or anxiety"
  image: whatever.png
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>Children with ADHD, PTSD or generalized anxiety benefit from 
  neurofeedback from an EEG while performing a task (e.g. focusing, calming) to develop cognitive skills 
  that can assist them to cope and perform better throughout life. Some problems with this training 
  a) the tools need to be easy to access and setup (e.g. wearable); b) the feedback should be engaging 
  and ideally involving multiple senses (e.g. visual, auditory, 3D, aromas); and c) the feedback should 
  be based on both brain waves (EEG) and other indicators (e.g. body motion, heart rate, breathing rate) 
  to provide richer self-understanding.
  <br>Problem: Develop an app for use with a wearable neurofeedback system (e.g. Muse, Emotiv, OpenBCI) 
  that provides richer environmental feedback and/or sensing to better serve the ADHD, PTSD or 
  generalized anxiety pediatric populations.

  title: "Bidsme -- bidsifier for multimodal datasets"
  image: whatever.png
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>One of the great ideas behind BIDS is unification of various modalities in the same dataset, sharing common metadata and providing
  a self-sufficient dataset ready to analyse. However various bidsificators target only one or two modalities. Bidsme project has been developed to provide a bidsificator
  as universal as possible, both in modalities and data formats. The project is based on two main ideas: <br>  1. everything that is laboratory-depending (log files, events,
  demographic info, psychological assessments, format conversions) must be treated via plugins. <br>  2. Data treated in object-oriented way: master class do the bidsifications,
  modality sub-class defines the BIDS-related parameters (entities, JSON fields etc...), data-format sub-sub-class implements how to read metadata. <br>Using this approach it
  is possible to integrate a new modality from scratch in one week, and fully create plugins for a given dataset in few days.

  My vision now is to make it become the Swiss Army Knife for tractography: a tool able to try out things, even when you do not have the right software installed (!!!).
  The dream would be typing just 'trampolino --corpus-callosum' and getting the tractogram for a corpus callosum to play with!

  title: "Virtual Neuro Machine (VNM)"
  image: virtualneuromachine.png
  details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.<br>With the advent of container technology, cumbersome virtual machines 
  have been reduced to a single container file that can be easily run on multiple-environments. Containers 
  can be run both interactively (e.g., within a Virtual Machine on the cloud) and in batch processing 
  (e.g., on HPC), thus contributing to reproducibility across stages of the analysis. The goal of this 
  project is to generate a "virtual neuro machine" container, i.e. a large container that includes most 
  popular neuroimaging tools, and can be used as a stand-alone VM. Although tools to generate neuroimaging 
  software containers are already in place (e.g., neurodocker), continued maintenance of such a large 
  container with complex library dependencies requires in-built testing capabilities, and especially so, 
  of included GUI applications. This project will bring together people working on different environments 
  and using different neuroimaging tools, in order to: 1) build a working container with the newest software
  versions available in June 2020, 2) develop in-built testing capabilities, to facilitate future container 
  upgrades, 3) develop a standard "home screen" for the container, to provide common interface across host 
  environments.
